## My process

### Built with

HTML5
CSS3
Flexbox
CSS Grid
Non-semantic HTML (lesson learned to use semantic tags like <section> for better structure)

### What I learned

In this project, I deepened my understanding of Flexbox and CSS Grid, especially in managing columns and rows for layout purposes. I used #id selectors to style the cards and learned how to efficiently structure elements with a single element handling all the cards. After completion, I learned about the importance of semantic HTML, such as using the <section> tag.

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

I want to improve my understanding of grid layouts and how to effectively position items in rows and columns. Additionally, I aim to enhance my use of semantic HTML for better accessibility and structure in future projects.
